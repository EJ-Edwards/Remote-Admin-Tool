# Sentinel Link — Remote Device Management System

A secure, authenticated remote administration system built with **Python**, **Sockets**, and a **Flask-based web dashboard**.  
Designed for **educational, security research, and authorized device management**.

---

## 🚀 Features

- **Secure PIN Authentication**  
  Custom PIN handshake between server ↔ client.

- **Web Dashboard (Flask UI)**  
  - List connected clients  
  - View live output/logs per client  
  - Send commands and receive output  

- **Cross-Platform Client**  
  Works on Windows, Linux, macOS  

- **System Management Commands**  
  - `sysinfo` — OS and processor info  
  - `hostname` — Computer name  
  - `whoami` — Current user  
  - `ls` / `dir` — List files and folders  
  - `pwd` — Current directory  
  - `read_file` — View file content  
  - `disk_usage` — Show storage usage  
  - `list_processes` — Running processes  
  - `uptime` — System uptime  

- **Customizable PIN & Port**  
  Easily secure your server on launch  

- **Exporting feature** 
  - For right now you are only able to export small single files
  - You can find the exported files in the Remote-Admin-Tool when you git clone it
  - You should see a folder called exports and when you click on it you should see what you requested exported

## 🤝 Contribution & Motivation
Sentinel Link was created to explore how secure, authenticated remote administration can be implemented with lightweight tools like Python sockets and a Flask dashboard. The motivation behind this project is twofold:
- Educational Value: To help developers and security researchers understand the fundamentals of remote device management, authentication handshakes, and cross-platform client-server communication.
- Practical Experimentation: To provide a safe, authorized environment for experimenting with system commands, dashboards, and secure connections without relying on heavy enterprise solutions.
We welcome contributions from the community to improve Sentinel Link and expand its capabilities:
- 🔧 Feature Enhancements: Add new system commands, improve exporting functionality, or extend dashboard features.
- 🛡️ Security Improvements: Strengthen authentication, encryption, and logging practices.
- 🌍 Cross-Platform Testing: Help validate and refine client behavior across different operating systems.
- 📖 Documentation & Tutorials: Improve c
